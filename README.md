## Employee Attrition data analysis
Employee attrition (or turnover) is a critical issue in organizations, impacting productivity and costs. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company using various factors like job role, salary, work-life balance, and more.

# Overview
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training using XGBoost, Random Forest
Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Hyperparameter tuning for better predictions

# Dataset 
"https://github.com/shravanibhojane/EmployeeAttrition/blob/main/employee_attrition.csv"

The dataset consists of 30 features related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, work experience, etc.
The target variable is "Attrition" (Yes/No).

# Results & Accuracy
The XGBoost model achieved:

Accuracy: ~85-90%
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Well-balanced
